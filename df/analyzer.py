#                     Dataflow Analysis Procedure                        #
#                                                                        #
# Steps:                                                                 #
# 1. For each block b                                                    #
#        compute transform function. This dependence on the analysis     #
#        to be computed. eg. The transform will be different for         #
#        live variable than for reaching definition. Thus requiring      #
#        a "plugin" architecture.                                        #
#                                                                        #
#        let the flow function becalled Fb                               #
#                                                                        #
# 2. Using the `Control Tree Representation` of each procedure compute   #
#    the intra-procedural dataflow information.                          #
#                                                                        #
#    The algorithms is two pass over the nodes of the control-tree.      #
#                                                                        #
#    The first pass is a bottom-up over the nodes in the tree. It        #
#    computes the flow functions for each node. The basic blocks should  #
#    have already been computed in step one and the internal nodes       #
#    should be schematically constructed.                                #
#                                                                        #
#    The second pass is top-down. It starts from the node representing   #
#    the entire procedure and from the initial node (entry for forward   #
#    problems, exit for backward). It then evaluates the date-flow       #
#    functions that propagate the flow information through out the tree. #
#                                                                        #
#    The meet and join operators like the flow functions themselves      #
#    depend on the particular problem being solved. So in general        #
#    they will also need to be inputs into the procedure                 #
#                                                                        #
